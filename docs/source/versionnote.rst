.. note::
   Currently, Pyroughtime implements the version of the Roughtime protocol described by
   `draft-ietf-ntp-roughtime-11
   <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-ntp-roughtime-11>`_. Since both the Roughtime
   protocol and this library is under development, the supported Roughtime version and the API may
   change at any time.
